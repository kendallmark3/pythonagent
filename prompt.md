Awesome — I see your Python agent training repo now and it’s perfect for what you want to teach. ￼

Here’s a ready-to-paste Markdown file you can drop into your Wix article or even into the repo as a guided “Start Here” page.

It walks readers through:
	•	What the repo is
	•	What they’ll learn
	•	How to run it
	•	How to progress from beginner → intermediate → advanced
	•	Where this connects to your site’s mission

Welcome to the Python Agent Training Center

This repo — PythonAgent: Training Center for Python Agents (GitHub)￼ — isn’t just code.
It’s an interactive learning path to build, run, and master real AI agents with Python. It’s designed for engineers and architects who want something practical, not theoretical. ￼

⸻

🎯 What You’ll Learn Here

This project teaches real-world, no-hype Python agents by guiding you through:
	1.	Running your first agent
	2.	Understanding how it thinks
	3.	Evolving it into useful workflows
	4.	Adding tooling and integrations
	5.	Learning industry best practices

It’s hands-on, incremental, and production-aware — exactly how teams ship real systems.

🚀 How to Get Started

🧰 1. Clone & Open in Codespaces

This repo works great in GitHub Codespaces:
	1.	Click Code → Codespaces → Create new Codespace
	2.	Add your OPENAI_API_KEY as a Codespaces secret
	3.	You’re ready to run

⸻

▶️ 2. Run Your First Agent

Inside the Codespace terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python agents/jenny.py

This will start the “Jenny” agent — your first Python agent sandbox.

⸻

🔍 What the Code Actually Does

Here’s a high-level breakdown of key parts:

🧠 1. Agent Loop (agents/jenny.py)

An agent observes → thinks → acts → remembers
That’s it.

It’s a simple loop that talks to an LLM and decides what to do next. ￼

⸻

🔗 2. Core Modules
	•	llm.py — Handles model calls
	•	tools.py — Tool execution logic
	•	memory.py — Keeps agent context
	•	config.py — Settings and environment
	•	logging_conf.py — Debug output & observability

All are simple and explicit, so you can see what’s really happening without abstraction layers. ￼

🎓 Learn → Teach → Level Up

This repo is intentionally beginner-friendly but designed for progression:

1️⃣ Beginner:
	•	Run the agent
	•	Read the code
	•	Understand the loop

2️⃣ Intermediate:
	•	Add a new tool (e.g., call an API)
	•	Extend memory logic
	•	Make the agent more robust

3️⃣ Advanced:
	•	Integrate with FastAPI
	•	Add Redis / Kafka
	•	Add retries, logs, DLQ

⸻

📌 Best Practices You’ll Pick Up

Throughout this project, you’ll see and internalize:
	•	Agents are microservices with judgment
	•	Tools do execution, not thinking
	•	Keep memory simple at first
	•	Observe before you optimize
	•	Iterate fast, integrate slow

Each pattern here maps to how real teams ship and manage agentic systems.

🔗 Connect to the LearnTeachMaster Site

This repo is part of a larger learning ecosystem:
	•	The site’s articles walk through why agents matter
	•	This repo shows how agents work in Python
	•	Together they build your master path

You’ll find related posts — like cost breakdowns, design philosophies, and production-ready patterns — linked from your site’s homepage and linked directly in the repo docs. ￼

🧠 Feedback & Community

This project is just getting started. Your experimentation, feedback, and forks help make this a better training center for everyone.

🏁 Final Thought

Agents don’t have to be confusing.
They don’t need complex platforms on day one.
They need clarity, curiosity, and incremental practice.

This repo gives you all three.

If you want, I can also generate:
✅ A companion “Getting Started” video script
✅ A weekend workshop outline
✅ A beginner quiz/checklist to include in the article or repo

Just tell me which one you want next.
