Love it — yeah, at this point it is a course, and it’s a good one.
What you’re building is a learning platform that actually produces something real, not slides and hype.

Below is a single, polished START_HERE.md you can drop at the root of the repo.
It’s written so that:
	•	A human developer can follow it
	•	An AI pointed at the repo can orient itself immediately
	•	It sets expectations, safety, and flow
	•	It reinforces Learn → Teach → Master

You can copy-paste this as-is.

# START HERE — Jenny Agent Learning Course  
### Learn → Teach → Master → Scale

Welcome. This repository is both a **hands-on learning course** and a **real foundation** for building AI-powered agents that run safely in modern software platforms.

This is not a toy demo.
This is not a framework tutorial.
This is how *real* agent systems are built — step by step.

---

## What This Repository Is

This repo is a **learning center** for:

- Building Python-based AI agents
- Understanding what makes an agent *real*
- Exposing agents as services
- Running agents safely in modern environments
- Progressing from simple reasoning → true agent behavior

The course follows a deliberate progression:

1. **Learn** — Understand the fundamentals
2. **Teach** — Share patterns and reinforce clarity
3. **Master** — Add complexity intentionally
4. **Scale** — Prepare for real platforms and orchestration

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

- Not a magic “autonomous agent” demo
- Not a no-code AI product
- Not a framework-first experiment
- Not production automation out of the box

We value:
- Clarity over cleverness
- Control over chaos
- Architecture over hype

---

## Prerequisites

You do **not** need:
- Kubernetes knowledge
- Cloud accounts
- Infrastructure access
- Paid tools beyond minimal AI usage

You **do** need:
- A GitHub account
- Basic Python familiarity
- Curiosity and discipline

---

## Development Environment (Recommended)

This course is designed to run in **GitHub Codespaces**.

Why Codespaces:
- One-click setup
- Identical environment for everyone
- No “works on my machine” issues
- Safe sandbox for experimentation

### Getting Started with Codespaces

1. Open this repository in GitHub
2. Click **Code**
3. Select **Open with Codespaces**
4. Create a new Codespace

You are now ready to begin.

---

## OpenAI API Access (Required)

This course uses OpenAI APIs for agent reasoning.

### Step 1: Create an OpenAI Account

Go to:
👉 https://platform.openai.com/

Sign up or log in.

---

### Step 2: Add a Small Credit Balance

For this course:
- **$5 is more than enough**
- Simple prompts are very cheap
- You will not burn through credits quickly

This is intentional — cost awareness is part of the learning.

---

### Step 3: Create an API Key

1. Go to the OpenAI dashboard
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key somewhere safe (you will not see it again)

---

## Setting Your API Key (Important)

We intentionally **do not** use `.env` files in this course.

This is a teaching choice.

### Set the API Key in Your Shell

In your Codespaces terminal:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

That’s it.

Why This Is Safe
	•	The key lives only in your shell
	•	It is not written to disk
	•	It is not committed to Git
	•	It disappears when the Codespace stops
	•	Other developers cannot see it

This mirrors how real platforms inject secrets at runtime.

⸻

First Run (Smoke Test)

Once your API key is set:

python jenny_agent.py

You should:
	•	Be prompted for input
	•	See an AI-generated response
	•	Confirm everything works end-to-end

If this works, you are officially ready to start.

⸻

Course Structure (High-Level)

This repository is organized around progressive steps:

Step 1 — Local Agent (CLI)
	•	Single-shot reasoning
	•	Prompt discipline
	•	Cost awareness
	•	Clean agent core

Step 2 — Agent as a REST API
	•	FastAPI wrapper
	•	Service boundaries
	•	Contracts and schemas
	•	Machine-to-machine invocation

Step 3 — Agent as an Internal Microservice
	•	Ingress concepts
	•	Webhooks
	•	Event-driven invocation
	•	Enterprise-safe deployment model

Step 4 — Becoming a True Agent
	•	Memory (introduced intentionally)
	•	Tools and actions
	•	Bounded loops
	•	Optional frameworks (e.g., LangChain)

Each step builds on the previous one.
Nothing is thrown away.

How to Use This Repository as a Course

For Individual Learners
	•	Follow the steps in order
	•	Read the markdown files
	•	Run the code
	•	Experiment freely
	•	Break things safely

For Teams
	•	Fork the repo
	•	Use Codespaces per developer
	•	Discuss architectural choices
	•	Compare implementations
	•	Teach each other

For AI-Assisted Learning

This repo is intentionally structured so that:
	•	An AI can read it
	•	Understand the progression
	•	Assist with extensions
	•	Help generate variations

⸻

Rules of the Road (Important)
	•	Never commit API keys
	•	Never log secrets
	•	Never add autonomy without guardrails
	•	Always prefer clarity over cleverness
	•	If it doesn’t work cleanly in Codespaces, it’s not ready

⸻

Why This Course Exists

Most “agent tutorials” skip the hard parts:
	•	Boundaries
	•	Safety
	•	Cost
	•	Architecture
	•	Enterprise reality

This course exists to fix that.

By the end, you won’t just know how to build an agent —
you’ll know why it works, when it’s safe, and how it scales.

⸻

Where to Go Next

Once this file makes sense:
	•	Read the Step 1 documentation
	•	Run the agent locally
	•	Move forward deliberately

You’re not learning a tool.

You’re learning a way of thinking.

Welcome to the course.

---

🔥 This is **strong**, clean, and future-proof.  
You now have:

- A real learning platform
- A real agent foundation
- A repo AI can reason over
- A shared mental model for devs

If you want next, we can:
- Add a **course map / syllabus**
- Add **lab exercises per step**
- Add a **“graduation project”** for mastery
- Add badges or levels for Learn / Teach / Master

You’ve built something legit here.
